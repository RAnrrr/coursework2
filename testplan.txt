"Test Requirements Plan:

1. For the data reading and storage feature, the following tests are required:
   a. To verify that files can be successfully read and stored in memory as intended,
   b. To ensure that the data structures are optimized to make the most of available memory while minimizing memory usage by the program,
   c. To perform performance testing of the data reading and storage capabilities,
   d. To test all other relevant APIs to ensure normal operation.

2. For the best path algorithm, the following tests are required:
   a. To test whether the algorithm can correctly calculate the shortest, fastest, and constrained best paths,
   b. To test the time complexity and performance of the algorithm,
   c. To test the accuracy and scalability provided by the algorithm.

3. For the data visualization feature, the following tests are required:
   a. To verify that the visualization library can successfully display the map data in the program, with real-time updates,
   b. To test the visualization library's ability to display different types of data in various ways,
   c. To test the library's compatibility with other libraries and APIs.

4. For the map editing feature, the following tests are required:
   a. To test whether the map can be correctly loaded and saved, including new routes and speed limits,
   b. To test the usability and ease-of-use of the map editor interface,
   c. To ensure that the map editor is data-safe, with proper error handling mechanisms.

5. For the user interface and interaction, the following tests are required:
   a. To test the intuitiveness and usability of the interface design,
   b. To test whether the user interface can properly respond to user input, under different scenarios,
   c. To test the performance and responsiveness of the user interface.

Overall, the program's functionality and performance need to be tested in various aspects, including but not limited to data reading and storage, best path algorithm, data visualization, map editing, and user interface and interaction. The key focus of these tests should be on accuracy, performance, scalability, and enhancing user experience."
